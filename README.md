# BMI Mass Calculator with IBM Granite AI Integration (Smart BMI Advisor with IBM Granite AI)
This project is an advanced Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator built with Next.js and React, designed to be more than a simple utility. Beyond standard BMI calculation, it features a comprehensive history management system and an intelligent advice feature powered by IBM Granite to provide personalized health guidance.

Users can input their height and weight to receive an instant BMI calculation, which is automatically saved to their personal history log. From there, they can trigger the AI advisor. The application sends the user specific data including their BMI value, category (e.g., Underweight, Normal, Overweight), height, and weight to the IBM Granite large language model. The AI then generates tailored workout and meal plan suggestions, which are used to update the corresponding entry in the user history. The history is fully interactive, allowing users to view detailed results and AI advice in a pop-up modal or delete entries as needed.

The core goal of this integration is to transform a standard calculator into an intelligent health companion. By bridging the gap between raw data and actionable insights, the Smart BMI Advisor offers users not just numbers, but clear, personalized guidance to help them understand and manage their health more effectively.
