# BMI Mass Calculator with IBM Granite AI Integration
This project is a simple yet powerful Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator built with Next.js and React. Beyond basic BMI calculation, it integrates an AI-powered advice system using IBM Granite to provide personalized recommendations.

Users can input their height and weight to calculate their BMI. Based on the calculated BMI category (underweight, normal, overweight, obese), the application then leverages the IBM Granite large language model to generate actionable and personalized advice. For instance, if a user is underweight, the AI might suggest strategies for healthy weight gain. If they are overweight, it could offer advice on healthy weight loss and lifestyle changes.

This integration aims to transform a standard utility tool into an intelligent personal health assistant, offering more than just numbers but also guidance towards ideal body mass management.
